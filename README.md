## Reflection &nbsp; 	:thought_balloon:

The inspiration behind this project is from a friend of mine who has a small tutoring academy and they needed a web application to automate repetitive tasks, implement a lesson booking feature and chat functionality between students and tutors, I thought it would be a great challenge for myself to try solve a real world business problem whilst practicing the technologies that I love to work with, fullstack JavaScript/TypeScript.

Some of the main challenges I ran into were Authentication and WebSockets, which took patience and practice to understand, I'm really glad I pushed myself to take this opportunity because it really made me dive into all aspects of developing a project end-to-end.

The technologies implemented in this project are <strong>Nest.js (Node.js), TypeScript, Vue 3, Pinia State Management and Tailwindcss</strong>. In my next project I am looking forward to build an application with <strong>Node.js and React</strong> to explore the differences between React and Vue on a deeper level.
