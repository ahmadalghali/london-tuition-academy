## Reflection

The inspiration behind this project is a friend of mine who has a small tuition academy and they needed a web application to automate repetitive tasks, implement lesson booking feature and chat functionality between students and tutors, I thought it would be a great challenge for myself to try solve a real world business problem whilst practicing the technologies that I love to work with, Node.js and Vue.js.

Some of the main challenges I ran into were Authentication and WebSockets, which took patience and practice to understand, I'm really glad I pushed myself to take this opportunity because it really made me dive into all aspects of developing a fullstack project.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are <strong>Nest.js (Node.js), TypeScript, Vue 3, Pinia State Management and Tailwindcss</strong>. In my next project I am looking forward to build an application with <strong>Node.js and React</strong> to get understand the differences between React and Vue on a better level.
